# cut_to_length_machine
This is the arduino sketch code that runs a machine I designed and fabricated that cuts leather stripping or plastic tubing into discrete pieces.
You can set the quantity and individual length of the pieces desired.
It makes use of a LCD screen, 4 push buttons to navigate and set machine parameters, stepper motor with speed and acceleration control, and pneumatic solenoid control.
